# Codex

Codex is a proof-of-concept sales tracking web app created for small business owners, particularly merchants who sell at craft fairs, art markets, and conventions.

## Background

This project started as a Google Sheet I made for my girlfriend with a custom script to generate new sheets for each convention that we sell at, in order to tabulate how much revenue we make during a given weekend. From there, it has evolved into an all-encompassing spreadsheet with inventory tracking, sales statistics for top selling products, and more. I wanted to incorporate these features into an application with a clean user interface, borrowing heavily from the web UI of our payment processing service of choice, Square.

## Features

### Manage your product library

Start by creating entries for each product you sell. Products can be organized into categories for more visual clarity. If you offer discounts (e.g. a "buy one, get one free" deal), you can track those as well.

### Track sales per convention

Events in Codex are called "conventions". When you add a new convention, Codex creates a dedicated convention page where you can enter sales numbers and track statistics such as revenue by payment type and top selling products. For multi-day events, each day will have its own tab with its own statistics for more granular information.

### View trends and more in the dashboard

The dashboard is where you can see statistics across multiple events. You can see total revenue for a given time period and compare with previous periods, as well as get statistics on your top selling products and product categories.
